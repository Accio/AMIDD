# Before we start ...

# Outline of today's course

# Phases of drug discovery

TA
  ~ Target assessment, should we invest to make a molecule modulating protein X?
  
Screening
  ~ Many molecules are evaluated and few, so-called *hits*, are prioritised.
  
LI
  ~ Lead identification, identify promising molecules chemists wish to work on

LO
  ~ Lead optimization, optimize pharmacological profiles of lead compounds
  
Phase I
  ~ Mainly for safety, mostly in healthy volunteers, but also patients possible
  
Phase II
  ~ Safety and efficacy, proof-of-concept
  
Phase III
  ~ Efficacy and efficacy, in large population

Phase IV
  ~ Follow-up study post approval
  
# Target assessment

\takehome{A good TA can lead to better understanding of biology}

# Screening

\takehome{Tailored screening stategy increases likelihood of success}

# LI and LO phase

\takehome{Molecular interaction and QSAR guides lead optimization}

# Preclinical safety

\takehome{To make a drug safe is no less important than making it work}

# PK/PD modelling and simulation

\takehome{PK/PD connects exposure, efficacy, and time}

# Clinical trials

* Experiment design
* Power analysis
* PTS (probability of technical success)
* ...
\takehome{Clinical trials can be tranquilizing for statisticians!}

# Biomarkers
