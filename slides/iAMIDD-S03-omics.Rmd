# Omics

## The central dogma

## Genomics

\takehome{Genomics among others helps to stratify patients}

## Transcriptomics

\takehome{Transcriptomics can characterize drug candidates}

## Proteomics

\takehome{Proteomics can identify biomarkers}

# Next-generation sequencing

## Principles

## Applications

# Mathematics and informatics underlying next-generation sequencing

## Mapping reads to the genome with BWA

## Mapping reads to the transcriptome with graph models

## Model gene expression data with negative-binomial distributions and generalized linear models

## Gene-set enrichment analysis

# Conclusions

## Omics complement the classical pharmacological studies of drug candidates
