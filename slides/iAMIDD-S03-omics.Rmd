# Omics

## The central dogma

## Genomics

\takehome{Genomics among others helps to stratify patients}

## Transcriptomics

\takehome{Transcriptomics among others characterizes drug candidates}

## Proteomics

\takehome{Proteomics among others identifies biomarkers}

# Next-generation sequencing

## Principles

\takehome{NGS generate reads from DNA}

## Mapping reads to the genome with BWA

\takehome{BWA is an efficient way to map reads to the genome}

## Mapping reads to the transcriptome with graph models

\takehome{Graph models allow fast mapping of reads to transcriptome}

## Model gene expression data with negative-binomial distributions and generalized linear models

\takehome{NB+GLM model NGS gene expression and differential expression}

## Gene-set enrichment analysis

\takehome{Competative and self-containing methods are available for GSEA}

# Conclusions

## Omics complement classical pharmacological studies of drug candidates
