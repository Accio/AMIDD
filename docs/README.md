Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery* (AMIDD)!

AMIDD runs at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Basel, annually in the fall semester. The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the language and computation as the tool.

We welcome bachelor, master, and PhD students of diverse backgrounds including (but not limited to) mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

The course is *in-person only*. Remote or virtual attendance is unfortunately not feasible. We have a diverse and lively class room that work with and learn from each other interactively, which is challenging in a virtual or hybrid setting.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/vorlesungsverzeichnis?id=293921).
