Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2021.

We focus on interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the
language and informatics as the tool. More information on the course can be
found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=258849).

## Lectures with Zoom

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in 2021 will take place online with
*Zoom* exclusively. The link to join the Zoom meeting is:
[https://unibas.zoom.us/j/68803401669](https://unibas.zoom.us/j/68803401669).
The passcode for the Zoom meeting is shared among registered students via
emails.

## Time and place

The lecture takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 on Zoom. The meeting
will be active between 12:00 and 14:00, so that any questions can be addressed
before the lecture.

## Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, are
shared on the course's web site, [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch), unless otherwise
specified in the course.

All Zoom sessions are recorded and distributed among attendees.

All course material, unless otherwise stated, is shared under the Creative
