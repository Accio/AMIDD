Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2024.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and computation as the tool. We welcome bachelor,
master, and PhD students of diverse backgrounds including (but not limited to)
mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, (computational) biology,
pharmacy, and other fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

The course is *in-person only*. Remote or virtual attendance is unfortunately
not feasible. We have a diverse and lively class room that work with and learn
from each other interactively, which is challenging in a virtual or hybrid
setting.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/home?id=286574).
