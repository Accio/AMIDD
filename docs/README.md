Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2021.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and informatics as the tool. We have a diverse and
lively class room that learn together and from each other: every year about two
third students of the class study mathematics or computer science, while other
students study physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other
fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=258849).

## Lectures with Zoom

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in 2021 will take place online with
*Zoom* exclusively. The link to join the Zoom meeting is:
[https://unibas.zoom.us/j/68803401669](https://unibas.zoom.us/j/68803401669).
The passcode for the Zoom meeting is shared among registered students via
emails.

## Time and place

The lecture takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 on Zoom. The meeting
will be active between 12:00 and 14:00, so that any questions can be addressed
before the lecture.

## Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, are
shared on the course's web site, [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch), unless otherwise
specified in the course.

All Zoom sessions are recorded and distributed among attendees.

All course material, unless otherwise stated, is shared under the Creative
Commons (CC-BY-SA 4.0) license.

## Pre-course survey

Prior to attending the first session, please [fill out the voluntary pre-course
survey](https://forms.gle/Qd6PdWv5LuwZDw6w7). It helps me to shape the course to

### 7. Omics and cellular modelling

### 9. Population modelling and clinical trials


### 10. *Dies academicus - optional Ask Me Anything session*


You can ask me anything in this session, which will be exceptionally *not* recorded.

Besides scientific topics in drug discovery, my experience is that many students are interested in career topics: should I do a PhD or not? Should I consider working in industry? These and other questions are asked again and again. While I cannot provide any definitive answer for you, I am glad to share some of my thoughts. For instance, you may this article below interesting if you consider doing a PhD and perhaps doing a postdoc in pharma: Zhang, Jitao David. “[Ten Simple Rules for Doing a Postdoc in Pharma.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008989)” PLOS Computational Biology 17, no. 6 (June 3, 2021): e1008989.


### 11. Guest-speaker session


### 12. Student presentation (I)


### 13. Student presentation (II)


## Student presentation topics and reference papers

You can vote for your presentation topics via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/pov9pfaitWAwVoFS9) by November the first.

## End-term project


## Assessment


The final note is given by participation (40%), presentation (30%), and project
