Welcome to the website for *Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery*, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Basel.

## Time and place

The lecture takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 in Seminarraum 5.002, Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Basel, Spiegelgasse 1, 4051 Basel.

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, are shared on the course's web site, [amidd.ch](http://amidd.ch), unless otherwise specified in the course.

## Assessment

The final note is given by participation (20%), presentation (30%), and an oral examination (50%). 

The oral examination will be about concepts that we learned together, and about explaining mathematical concepts (or concepts in your domain of experts) to a layman - your lecturer.

## Further information

* We focus on interdisciplinary research with mathematics as the language and informatics as the tool.

* I do not offer exercise hour yet. Pre-reading and post-reading articles, as well as videos, are shared and recommended.

* Both slides and board are used for the course. Slides and notes are shared.
