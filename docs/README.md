Welcome to the website for *Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics
In Drug Discovery*, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2020.

We focus on interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the
language and informatics as the tool. More information on the course can be
found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=251981).

## Lectures with Zoom: registration required

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in 2020 will take place online with
*Zoom*.
