## Assessment

The final note is given by participation (20%), presentation (30%), and an oral examination (50%). 

The oral examination (20 min) will be about concepts that we learned together, and about explaining mathematical concepts (or concepts in your domain of experts) to a layman - your lecturer.

## Further information

* We focus on interdisciplinary research with mathematics as the language and informatics as the tool.

* I do not offer exercise hour yet. Pre-reading and post-reading articles, as well as videos, are shared and recommended.

* Both slides and board are used for the course. Slides and notes are shared.
