Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2022.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and informatics as the tool. We have a diverse and
lively class room that learn together and from each other: every year about two
third students of the class study mathematics or computer science, while other
students study physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other
fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=269095).

### 10. *Dies academicus - optional Ask Me Anything session*

You can ask me anything in this session.

Besides scientific topics in drug discovery, my experience is that many students
are interested in career topics: should I do a PhD or not? Should I consider
working in industry? You may this article below interesting if you consider
doing a PhD and perhaps doing a postdoc in pharma: Zhang, Jitao David. “[Ten
Simple Rules for Doing a Postdoc in
Pharma.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008989)” PLOS Computational
Biology 17, no. 6 (June 3, 2021): e1008989.

### 11. Population modelling

### 12. Guest-speaker session

To be announced

## 13-14. Student presentations

You can vote for your presentation topics via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/pov9pfaitWAwVoFS9) by November the first.

In HS 2021, our class will present on four topics: machine learning, causal
inference, drug discovery for SARS-Cov-2, and mathematical and computational
modelling. Each team is expected to deliver a talk of 30 minutes, which is
followed by 10 minutes of Q&A.

## End-term project

All participants are expected to finish the end-term project either individually
or in a team of two people. She or he or the team shall choose *one* concept from a list of candidate topics, upon which they will write a short essay introducing the
concept to non-experts, with examples and ideally applications in drug
discovery. The topics will be announced during the semester.

The essay should have an abstract (less than 200 words), a list of references,
and a main text that does not exceed 3,000 words. Visual elements like table and
figures that help readers understand the concept are welcome but not obligatory.
In case of a team work, the contribution of the two people should be specified.

Essays in literature-programming styles, combining texts and source code with
Jupyter notebook or Rmarkdown, are welcome. For such essays the source code does
not count to the total words.

List of candidate topics of year 2021 as a reference:p

1. [Simple/Statistics] Statistical power and sample-size calculation
2. [Simple/Machine learning] Principal component analysis (PCA)
3. [Simple/Algorithm] The Viterbi algorithm
4. [Simple/Mathematical modelling] The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model
5. [Moderate/Statistics] Exploratory factor analysis
6. [Moderate/Machine learning] Classification and regression trees
7. [Moderate/Causal inference] Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for causal inference
8. [Challenging/Causal inference] Mendelian randomization
9. [Challenging/Algorithm] Community detection with Leiden clustering
10. [Challenging/Statistics] Simpson's paradox and mixed models

The choice of topic and the team composition is to be submitted via [this Google Form of voting for the project topic](https://forms.gle/VUTeFqsbu3yoF2DDA) by *Friday, December the 3rd*. Two people working together need to vote just once. The deadline for submitting the essay by email is *January 14th, 2022*. No extension is possible.

Once the essays are submitted, they will be shared with the whole class for open review and joint learning.

## Assessment

The final note is given by participation (40%), presentation (30%), and project
work (30%).
