Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2023.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and computation as the tool. We have a diverse and
lively class room that learn together and from each other: every year about two
third students of the class study mathematics or computer science, while other
students study physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other
fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=276986).
