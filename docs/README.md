Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2024.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and computation as the tool. We welcome bachelor,
master, and PhD students of diverse backgrounds including (but not limited to)
mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, (computational) biology,
pharmacy, and other fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

The course is *in-person only*. Remote or virtual attendance is unfortunately
not feasible. We have a diverse and lively class room that work with and learn
from each other interactively, which is challenging in a virtual or hybrid
setting.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/home?id=286574).

### Lecture 1: Introduction to drug discovery

The first lecture introduces drugs and drug discovery.

* Preparatory reading/watching
    * If you need a refresher of the central dogma of biology, please watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kOGOY7vthk).
    * If you are not familiar with the process of drug discovery and development, you may benefit from watching [this YouTube video made by Novartis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gl0gAcW8rw).
* [Slides of lecture 1]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2024/01/AMIDD-2024-01-Intro.pdf %})
    * Coincidentally, just the day before the lecture,  the news broke that three scientists - Joel Habener, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, and Svetlana Mojsov - were awarded the prestigious Lasker~Debakey clinical medical research award *for the discovery and development of GLP-1 based drugs that have revolutionized the treatment of obesity*. [Website of the Lasker Foundation](https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/glp-1-based-therapy-for-obesity/). I thank Urs Saner who shared the news with me.
* There is no offline activity this week. However, [please fill out the anonymous post lecture survey](https://forms.gle/5g6T63zaGyopzoE39).
