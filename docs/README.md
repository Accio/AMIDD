Welcome to the website for *Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics
In Drug Discovery*, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2020.

We focus on interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the
language and informatics as the tool. More information on the course can be
found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=251981).

## Lectures with Zoom: registration required

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in 2020 will take place online with
*Zoom*.

In order to attend the interactive lectures, please register yourself once for
the Zoom meetings with
[this link at https://unibas.zoom.us](https://unibas.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwof-6upzktE92okfuCd-2UY3z8iQWvF7Dk).

Nicolò Milani got his PhD at University of Perugia (Italy) in collaboration with
Molecular Discovery Ltd. The main topic of his PhD was the application of *in
vitro* data in combination with molecular modelling for drug metabolism
investigation. The area of interest was mostly h-Aldehyde Oxidase and h-UGT2B10.
The h-UGT2B10 project was in collaboration with Roche and he spent one year in
Basel. He started his Postdoc in Roche one year ago and his project is about the
quantitative application of mathematical modelling for complex in vitro systems
(e.g. Organ-on-a-Chip) in DMPK.

Philipp Mekler is a biochemist, mathematician, and businessman, with more than
forty years' experience in life sciences.

* Attendance is voluntary.
* If you can prepare your questions and share them with me in advance, I will
  prepare for them. Spontaneous questions are equally welcome.

  titled *Ten Simple Rules for Doing A Postdoc in Pharma: Pros, Precautions, and
  Preparations*. The manuscript is currently under review and [the preprint is
  available here]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link
  assets/2020/11/2020-08-03-industrial-postdocs-ten-simple-rules.pdf %}), which
  is permitted by the publisher. Though the primary target audience of the piece

  other students of the class.

   * Precautions are warranted: machine learning has its own limitations,
     especially if our goal is to increase the productivity of drug discovery.

## End-term project

I expect every participant to choose one concept from the list below and to
write a short essay (1000-2500 words) introducing the concept for non-experts,
with examples and ideally applications in drug discovery.

List of candidate topics:

1. Statistical power and sample size calculation
2. Information (Shannon) entropy
3. Principal component analysis (PCA)
4. Non-negative matrix factorization
5. The Viterbi algorithm
6. MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo)
7. The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm
8. Agent-based modelling
9. Gaussian process
10. Bayesian networks

The preference is to be submitted by a Google Form (sent out via emails) by
December the 10<sup>th</sup>, Thursday. The deadline for submitting the essay is January
the 15<sup>th</sup>, 2021, Friday. No extension is possible.

## Assessment

The final note is given by participation (40%), presentation (30%), and project
work (30%).
