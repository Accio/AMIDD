Welcome to the website for *Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics
In Drug Discovery*, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2020.

We focus on interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the
language and informatics as the tool. More information on the course can be
found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=251981).

## Lectures with Zoom: registration required

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in 2020 will take place online with
*Zoom*.

In order to attend the interactive lectures, please register yourself once for
the Zoom meetings with
[this link at https://unibas.zoom.us](https://unibas.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwof-6upzktE92okfuCd-2UY3z8iQWvF7Dk).
The registration is necessary for students who want to get credits and for
auditors.

## Time and place

The lecture takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 13:45 exclusively on Zoom.
The meeting will be active between 12:00 and 14:00, so that any questions to the
lecturer can be addressed before and after the lecture.

You can add the events to your calendar once you register for the Zoom meetings
with the link above.

* If you can prepare your questions and share them with me in advance, I will
  prepare for them. Spontaneous questions are equally welcome.
* For career-relevant questions, I have prepared an appetizer, an opinion piece
  titled *Ten Simple Rules for Doing A Postdoc in Pharma: Pros, Precautions, and
  Preparations*. The manuscript is currently under review and [the preprint is
  available here]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link
  assets/2020/11/2020-08-03-industrial-postdocs-ten-simple-rules.pdf %}), which
  is permitted by the publisher. Though the primary target audience of the piece
  is PhD students, I am happy if some aspects turn out to be useful also for
  other students of the class.

### 12. Guest-speaker session (II) (4.12)

* Guest speaker Detlef Wolf (12:15-13:00)
* Guest speaker Jenny Devenport (13:10-13:55)

### 13. Student presentation (I) (11.12.)

### 14. Student presentation (II) (18.12.)

## Assessment

The final note is given by participation (40%), presentation (30%), and project
work (30%).

The project work will be about concepts that we learned together and their
applications in practice. The work will be judged by how you work within a team,
how you find and integrate information, and how well you explain your findings
to a general, non-expert readership. Details will follow when the attendee list
is finalized.

## Further questions or suggestions?
