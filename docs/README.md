Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* (AMIDD), the course series running at the Department of Mathematics
and Informatics, University of Basel in the fall semester 2023.

The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with
mathematics as the language and computation as the tool. We have a diverse and
lively class room that learn together and from each other: every year about two
third students of the class study mathematics or computer science, while other
students study physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other
fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=276986).

## Time and place

The lecture takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 at Spiegelgasse 5,
Seminarraum 05.002.

## Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, are
shared on the course's web site, [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch), unless otherwise
specified in the course.

## Pre-course survey

Prior to attending the first session, please [fill out the voluntary pre-course
survey](https://forms.gle/Xbk6ExbfNUxUgqm76). Your reply helps me to shape the
course to meet your needs.

## Assessment

The final note is given by participation including quizzes (30%), offline
activities (40%), and a collaboration challenge in the final session (30%).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 7. From individual interactions to networks

* [Slides]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link
  assets/2022/07/AMIDD-2022-07-from-individual-interactions-to-networks.pdf %}).
  This week we discussed QSAR, machine learning models, and causal inference.
  And we introduced compartment models to model ligand-receptor interaction and
  enzyme kinetics. Next week we will continue with the compartment model and
  biological network analysis.
* This week's offline activity is to finish the readings of the last week.
     * Required reading: [*An introduction to machine learning*]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2022/06/Badillo-ML-2020.pdf %}) by Badillo *et al.*.
     * Required reading for this and next week: [*Computational methods in drug discovery*]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2022/06/Sliwoski-PharmacologicalReviews-2014-Computational-Methods-In-Drug-Discovery.pdf %}) by Gregory Sliwoski *et al.*. Please submit your replies to questions [via this Google Form](https://forms.gle/pfKX76K5XYuzxNSu8). The deadline of submitting the replies is *November 11th*.
