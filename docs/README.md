Welcome to the website for *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery* (AMIDD)!

AMIDD runs at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Basel, annually in the fall semester. The course series introduces interdisciplinary research in drug discovery with mathematics as the language and computation as the tool.

We welcome bachelor, master, and PhD students of diverse backgrounds including (but not limited to) mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, (computational) biology, pharmacy, and other fields such as epidemiology and medicine.

The course is *in-person only*. Remote or virtual attendance is unfortunately not feasible. We have a diverse and lively class room that work with and learn from each other interactively, which is challenging in a virtual or hybrid setting.

More information on the course can be found at [the course directory of the University Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/vorlesungsverzeichnis?id=293921).

### Lecture 1: Introduction to drug discovery

The first lecture introduces drugs and drug discovery.

* Preparatory reading/watching
    * If you need a refresher of the central dogma of biology, please watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kOGOY7vthk).
    * If you are not familiar with the process of drug discovery and development, you may benefit from watching [this YouTube video made by Novartis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gl0gAcW8rw).
* [Slides of lecture 1]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2025/01/AMIDD-2025-01-Intro.pdf %})
* Offline activities:
     * Assignment: see slide #20. Please submit your response [via this Google Form](https://forms.gle/odndbRAZYiNJM8Zp9) latest by September 25th, Thursday, End of Business Day (EOB).
     * Please fill the [post-lecture survey](https://forms.gle/EK3nrqA3HvNHV9f3A). The due date is the same as the offline activities.

### Lecture 2: The *What*, the *Who*, and the *How* of drug discovery

In the second lecture, we discuss the workflow of modern drug discovery, the relevant stakeholders, and possible paths towards new drugs.

* [Slides of lecture 2]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2025/02/AMIDD-2025-02-What-Who-How.pdf %})
* Offline activities
    * Please [fill the post-lecture survey](https://forms.gle/ER9tr7JxtiDTzE9N8): I look forward to your feedback!
    * Assignment is [described here](https://forms.gle/gsckhwaHUvw82kzE8), which is a Google Form with which you will submit your answers. Deadline: EOB October 2nd.
    * Keep reading and thinking about your roles as pharma company, regulatory agency, insurance company, medical doctors, and patients, and exchanging with your fellow peers.

### Lecture 3: Key questions in drug discovery

In the third lecture, we explore the five key questions in drug discovery: medical need, target and modality, PK/PD, benefit and risk, and patient stratification.

* [Slides of lecture 3]({{site.assetbaseurl}}{% link assets/2025/03/AMIDD-2025-03-Key-Questions.pdf %})
* Offline activities
    * Please [fill the post-lecture survey](https://forms.gle/rdvaUDx3VdrtPLnJ9): I look forward to your feedback!
    * Assignment #1: If you need a quick refreshment of the concept of central dogma and the process of information flow from DNA to protein, check out [this video by *yourgenome*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA) (~3 min).
    * Assignment #2: Watch [the Nobel Prize Lecture by Katalin Karikó, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPdUnYjvWxo) (42 min).
