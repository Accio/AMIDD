Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery (AMIDD) is a course that I am building and expected to be given in the autumn semester 2019 to an audience of university students who are interested in the topic.

## Motivation

Interdisciplinary research is imperative to drug discovery and disease understanding in the industrial setting. Mathematics and informatics play a central role in orchestrating different fields of research and integrating available knowledge and information to enable decisions. The speed and quality of these decisions have direct impacts on life quality of patients and their families. It is therefore of common interest to systematically review concepts, tools, and approaches of applied mathematics and informatics in drug discovery to encourage innovation. 

## Goals 

It is hoped that with an introduction to mathematics and informatics in drug discovery, and especially the motivation and the impacts of their applications, the students are motivated to deepen their knowledge in relevant fields. Equally important, the students are encouraged to apply what they learn to solve open challenges in drug discovery and to gain new insights.

## Audience

This course is designed for all students who are interested in applied mathematics and informatics and their applications in modern drug discovery. Though no prerequisite courses are obligatory, elementary understanding of statistics and ordinary differential equations are helpful. Knowledge and proficiency in at least one programming language (preferably C/C++, Java, R, Python, and Julia) is very helpful to try real-world problems.

## Content

The course is designed to give a high-level overview of applications of mathematics and informatics tools in the value chain of drug discovery. Therefore, while key concepts and principles are introduced, most subjects can only be briefly touched. Intensive investigations into some subjects, for instance bioinformatics and computational biology, are planned as follow-up courses.

The course consists of 14 sessions (two hours each) and a final oral examination. The sessions will cover an introduction to drug discovery (1 session), bioinformatics (2 sessions),  experiment design and interpretation (1 session), computational biology (2 sessions), chemoinformatics and drug design (2 sessions), mechanistic modelling (2 sessions), pharmacology  (2 sessions), and emerging technologies between bench and bed for personalized healthcare such as imaging, digital biomarkers, and real-world data (2 sessions).  The sessions are so arranged that they roughly reflect the general drug discovery pipeline, starting from target assessment, transiting via screening, lead identification and optimization, preclinical safety evaluation, PK/PD modelling, clinical trials to regulatory approval.
