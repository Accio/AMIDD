## The Central Dogma

You and I can be thought as vehicles of information in evolution. Biological
information, together with the environment, determines our traits to a large
extend, such as height, weight, skin colour, health condition, etc. The
information is passed from parents to children in the form of deoxyribonucleic
acids (DNA). Human DNA form double-helices, which in turn forms complex
structures of higher hierarchies such as nucleosomes and chromosomes. As we will
see later, the hierarchical organisation pattern prevails in biology.

Information stored in DNA is transcribed into ribonucleic acids (RNA) by a large
apparatus of transcription. Human RNA is single-stranded, and some RNA species
are translated into chains of amino-acids, which form proteins. Proteins build
main components of our material body, catalyse chemical reactions which generate
metabolites, and act as signal sensors and function executors between cells and
their environments. To do that, proteins interact with each other, as well as
other molecules including DNA, RNA, metabolites, and other entities that can be
met a human body, ranging from water to viral particles to gas molecules. We
know about 20,000 proteins encoded by the human genome, many of which we know
little about beyond their sequence and likely structure.

DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites interact with each
other, forming heterogeneous biological networks. These networks are highly
mutable and dynamic: both the abundances of the nodes, i.e. those of DNA, RNA,
protein, and metabolite molecules, and the strength of interactions between the
nodes depend on many factors, among others the cell type, the cellular context
(for instance, whether a cell is derived of energy source, or whether it is
exposed to a drug), and the history of the cell. In another word, the network
changes both temporally and spatially. It is a surprising fact if we consider
that sequences of DNA, the most basic information vehicle, are almost identical
in all cells in a body. While exceptions known as genetic mosaicism do exist,
for instance due to spontaneous mutations (which may or may not lead to
cancers), they cannot explain the high complexity observed in biological
networks with regard to cell type.

On top of that, differences in the genetic make-up of individuals further
exacerbate the complexity between the chemical nature of the nodes, and
consequently the interactions among them, may vary from person to person.

The central goal of drug discovery, viewed from the angle of biological
networks, is to identify nodes and edges that can be modulated to halt or
reverse a disease condition, and to discover chemical molecules or biological
entities to achieve that goal with acceptable safety profiles. The fact that
biological networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and complex, or simply put,
messy, makes the process of drug discovery intellectually and practically
challenging and rewarding.
