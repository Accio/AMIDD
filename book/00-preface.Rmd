# Preface {-}

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progress. 

The history of *Homo sapiens* is strongly shaped by human diseases and fighting
against them.

The history of drug discovery is short. However, it has fundamentally improved
human health and life quality.

Drug discovery is one of the most interdisciplinary and collaborative human
enterprises. The first wave was the development in chemistry and physiology. In
the second wave, advances in molecular biology, genetics, and physics made
significant contribution. In the third wave, computational approaches such as
molecular modelling demonstrated its power. In the fourth wave,
high-dimensional, high-throughput technologies such as omics and imaging made
big impact. Now, we are experiencing the fifth wave, among others closer
integration of clinical-trial and real-world data with preclinical research
(forward and reverse translation), and integrative and iterative approaches
combining both wet-lab experiments and *in silico* data analysis and modelling.
There is little doubt that future waves will bring more opportunities to find
new drugs.

These waves do not only offered new drugs against various diseases. They also
gradually revealed the importance of mathematics and informatics in drug
discovery. In the first wave, .... In the second wave, mathematical language to
describe human genetic information and computational tools to store, retrieve,
and analyse them brought disciplines such as cheminformatics and bioinformatics
to the core business of pharma research. Next, high-dimensional statistics,
pattern recognition and machine learning tools demonstrate their power to mine
large-volume data of heterogeneous types. Looking ahead, system-modelling
approaches such as network modelling and multiscale modelling become ever more
important.

## Targeted readership {-}

This book aims primarily at providing undergraduate and graduate students as
well as drug-discovery researchers trained in relevant fields, in particular
mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine, an
practical introduction to drug discovery, particularly the quantitative methods
and tools used.

Prerequisite is high-school level knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics,
and biology. 

## Organization of the book {-}

### Part I: Overview of drug discovery {-}

#### Chapter one: introduction to drug discovery {-}

In this chapter, we sketch a brief history of drug discovery, focusing
especially on how quantitative methods change our way to finding drugs, and
important aspects of drug discovery today, especially the choice of target-based
and phenotypic drug discovery, as well as the modalities.

#### Chapter two: the linear view of drug discovery {-}

The linear view of the drug discovery process can be found everywhere from
scientific publications to pharma companies' websites. Why they are so
popular? What are the advantages of disadvantages of this view? What can we
learn from this view of drug discovery?

#### Chapter three: the multiscale-modelling view of drug discovery {-}

We provide an alternative view to modern drug discovery
based on mathematical, statistical, and computational models at different
levels. What is the benefit of this alternative view? 

### Part II: Molecular modelling {-}

Chapter four to six focus on molecular modelling of the targets, where as
chapter seven to nine focus on molecular modelling of the drug candidates and
their interactions with the targets.

#### Chapter four: the Central Dogma and drug targets {-}

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates the rules of information flow in
biological systems. We examine the central dogma and study drug targets from an
information theory prospective.

#### Chapter five: biological sequence analysis {-}

Biological sequence analysis plays an important role in drug target
identification and assessment. We examine both deterministic and probabilistic
approaches to analyse biological sequences, and their applications in drug
discovery.

#### Chapter six: structure of DNA, RNA, and protein {-}

In target-based drug discovery, high-quality structural information of the target molecule
can strongly determine how a project is pursued. We examine structural
properties of drug target molecules that are most relevant for drug discovery,
and examine mathematical and informatics models involved.

#### Chapter seven: cheminformatics {-}

Cheminformatics uses computer-science languages and tools to describe chemical
molecules, and make predictions about their properties. It finds wide
application in drug discovery. In this chapter, we review some relevant aspects.

#### Chapter eight: modelling of oligonucleotides {-}

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and duplex RNAs are two classes of most widely
used molecules to target RNAs. Sequence-based and thermodynamic modelling of
DNA/RNA and RNA/RNA interaction are critical to identify drug candidates with
favourable efficacy and toxicity properties. We review key modelling methods
here.

#### Chapter nine: antibody design {-}

Antibodies are proteins that bind to and modulate the function of other
proteins. Engineered human antibodies represent an important class of drugs. In
this chapter, we discuss the mathematical and computational models that are
critical for antibody design.

### Part III: cellular and omics modelling {-}

#### Chapter ten: biological network analysis {-}

Graph, or network, is an important mathematical model that links molecular-level 
modelling with cellular and omics modelling. We examine both deterministic and
probablistic approaches of analysing biological networks.

#### Chapter eleven: DNA and RNA sequencing {-}

Genomics and transcriptomics studies with high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing greatly
expanded the ability of drug discovery scientists to both undrestand the
etiology of diseases and to assess the efficacy and safety liability profiles of
drug candidates. We introduce the key concepts and models to analyse the data.

#### Chapter twelve: proteomics and metabolomics {-}

Proteomics and metabolics technologies find a wide range of applications in drug
discovery, from quantification of drug-target binding to accurate determination of
biomarkers. We introduce the key concepts and models to analyse the data.

#### Chapter thirteen: biological imaging {-}

Biological imaging offers an orthogonal approach to investigate biological
processes and the effect of drug perturbation. We introduce selected techniqus
of biological imaging that are commonly used in drug discovery, with a
particular emphasis on modelling approaches to analyse
the data.

### Part 4: Organ and system-level modelling {-}

#### Chapter fourteen: introduction to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {-}

Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling describes what the body
does to the drug, and what the drug does to the body, respectively. We introduce
how mathematical modelling is used to characterize PK and PD profile of drug
candidates.

#### Chapter fifteen: physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling {-}

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling represents our knowledge of
human physiology in mathematical structures, and is applied for a wide range of
purposes from animal-human translation and pediatric dose selection. In this
chapter we introduce the basic concepts and tools in PBPK modelling.

#### Chapter sixteen: systems models {-}

Systems models offer an integrative approach to combine mechanistic preclinical
safety data with PK and patient-specific characteristics. They can assess safety
liabilities under different dosing regimens in different populations
quantitatively. They can also identify mechanisms underlying liabilities, which
may offer insight for compound optimisation.

### Part 5: population modelling and reverse translation {-}

#### Chapter seventeen: design of random clinical trials {-}

We introduce key characteristics of random clinical trials and statistical
considerations.

#### Chapter eighteen: population modelling {-}

Population modelling informs common trends and individual variabilities of drug
PK and PD profiles. It is used to infer associations between individual
variables (age, sex, genotype, *etc.*) and PK/PD profiles in clinical
pharmacology studies. We introduce the basic basic concepts of population modelling, in particular non-linear mixed
effect modelling.

#### Chapter nineteen: real-world data and reverse translation {-}

Real-world data is a collective term of data that are collected about patients,
their medical history, and other data types that can be potentially used to
infer efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Classically, real-world data and
clinical data are analysed in a 'for-purpose' fashion. Recently, however,
researchers realise the potential to use such data to inform preclinical
discovery. We examine key modelling approaches used as well as both
opportunities and challenges.
