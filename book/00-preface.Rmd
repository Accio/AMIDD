*Proposal for the book 'Multiscale modelling in drug discovery'*

## Modelling in drug discovery

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progress. The history
of modern drug discovery, which started around 1860, is short compared with
that of human and human diseases. It has, however, fundamentally changed the
life of each of us. 

Today, drug discovery represents one of the most interdisciplinary and
collaborative human research enterprises. Early drug discovery was primarily
driven by trial-and-errors in biology (especially microbiology), medicine, and
chemistry. As the techniques of drug discovery developed and refined,
mathematical, statistical, and computational modelling has become essential
besides experimental approaches. We apply such models mainly for two reasons. 

First, we apply these models to study human body as a biochemical system. Since
the system is large and complex, we usually consider a part of it, for
instance the liver infected by the hepatitis B virus or a melanoma (skin
tumour), as a sub-system. From this perspective, health and diseases are treated
as the states of the system. Mathematical, statistical, and computational models
are used to characterize the different states of the system: what variables are
correlated with the state of the system? Which variables are causal for the
state, manipulating of which may worsen or cure the disease? For simplicity, we
say that models serve *disease understanding* in such contexts.

The other application of mathematical, statistical, and computational models is
to characterize drug-body interactions. From our systems perspective, the goal
of drug discovery is to identify a perturbation, or combinations of
perturbations, to the sub-system that switches the state from 'disease' to
'health', while not causing harmful (adverse) effects to the whole system.

The capacity of a drug to switch the state of a sub-system from 'disease' to
'health' is defined as its *efficacy*. The capacity of a drug causing adverse
effects to the whole system is defined as its *safety*. Therefore, models also
serve *efficacy and safety profiling* in drug discovery.

Data of drug-body interactions are collected at multiple scales. We can roughly
classify them into molecular data, cellular data, organ- and system-level data,
and population data. Interpretation of models at individual levels and
integration of the results across the hierarchies allow us to make key
decisions, such as which drug target to work on or which molecule to test in
human, along the drug-discovery process. For simplicity, we say that models
serve *drug discovery* in such contexts.

It is obvious that the two types of applications are dependent on each other: a
better understanding of the disease may catalyse the discovery of new drugs with
better efficacy and safety profiles. The study of drug-body interactions does
not only provide chemical or biological tools to treat diseases. The drugs can
be used as perturbations to investigate biological systems, either in the
healthy state or in disease states. Such studies may reveal unexpected aspects
of the disease or even fundamental biology.

In summary, drug discovery can be viewed as an iterative process consisting of
experiments and modelling. The starting point consists of a disease that we wish
to cure and some biological or chemical entities as as drug candidates. We
collect data of the disease and conduct experiment to characterize the drug
candidates. Models characterize diseases as states of the system and encode our
understanding of drug-body interactions. Informed by these models, we use our
expertise in chemistry and biology to modify the drug candidate to improve its
efficacy and safety profile. In the next cycle, We perform experiments with the
improved drug candidate and construct improved models to update our belief in
how the molecule interacts with the body. The process is repeated until a drug
with desired efficacy and safety profiles is found. 

This book introduces basic concepts and principles of mathematical, statistical,
and computational modelling approaches for disease understanding and efficacy
and safety profiling in drug discovery. The aim is to
integrate modelling approaches at different levels into a unified,
*multiscale-modelling* view of drug discovery.

## Target readership {-}

This book aims at providing undergraduate and graduate students from relevant
fields (mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry,
pharmacology, *etc.*) an application-oriented introduction to the drug-discovery
process from the modelling perspective. It can also be used by researchers
working in the fields of disease understanding and drug discovery as a practical
guide to modelling.

Prerequisite is high-school knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
biology. Resources are provided in each chapter for self-learning of more
advanced (usually bachelor-level) knowledge. An appendix is available to refresh
the essential knowledge in mathematics, statistics, chemistry, and biology that
is used throughout the book.

## Organization of the book {-}

The book is organised in three parts:

1. Introduction to modern drug discovery
2. Modelling at individual levels
    1. Molecule-level modelling
    2. Cell-level modelling
    3. Organ- and system-level modelling
    4. Population modelling
3. Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art practice and prospectives

### Part I: Introduction to modern drug discovery {-}

#### Chapter one: introduction to drug discovery {-}

We sketch a brief history of drug discovery, focusing especially on how
development of mathematical modelling, statistical methods, and computational
methods change our way of finding drugs. 

Next we will examine three basic and important features of drug discovery hat
are relevant for later chapters of the book, namely:

1. the choice between target-based and phenotypic drug discovery,
2. the balance between efficacy and safety, and 
3. drug modalities that are currently pursued.

#### Chapter two: the linear view of drug discovery {-}

The linear view of the drug-discovery process is prevalent. It is found
everywhere from scientific publications to pharma companies' websites. In this
chapter, we will examine the linear view from multiple perspectives: how can we
interpret it? What is the time and cost associated with each stage? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of this view of drug discovery?

Once we are familiar with the linear view of drug discovery, we are ready to
take an alternative view in the next chapter, namely the multiscale-modelling
view, because it may help us better understand some aspects of drug discovery.

#### Chapter three: the multiscale-modelling view of drug discovery {-}

In this chapter, we examine a multiscale view of drug discovery, where data are
collected and mathematical, statistical, and computational models are built at
multiple levels: molecule-level, cellular level, system and organ level, and
population level. Models at different models are interconnected, informing and
providing feedback to each other.

We will scrutinize and challenge the multiscale modelling view as we did for the
linear view: what are its advantages and disadvantages? What new insights can it
bring to us?

With multiscale modelling as a mental model of the drug discovery
process, we will start our journey of learning principles, concepts, and tools
of modelling at individual levels. 

### Part II: Modelling at individual levels {-}

#### Part II.I: Molecular modelling {-}

Chapter four to six focus on molecular modelling of drug targets, including DNA,
protein and proteins. Chapter seven to nine go on introducing molecular modelling
of drug candidates and interactions with their targets.

#### Chapter four: the central dogma and drug targets {-}

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates the rules of information flow in
biological systems. It builds the foundation of drug discovery because drugs, in
order to treat diseases, must modulate components specified in the centra dogma.
We examine the central dogma, introduce its core components - DNA (genome), RNA
(transcriptome), and protein (proteome), and offer an overview of approved drugs
by their targets and their relationship with the central dogma.

#### Chapter five: biological sequence analysis {-}

DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis plays an important role in drug target
identification and assessment. We examine both deterministic and probabilistic
approaches to analyse biological sequences, with the examples of the Levenshtein
distance and (hidden) Markov chains, respectively.

We discuss selected applications of biological sequence analysis in the context
of drug discovery, including phylogenetic analysis and off-target prediction of
oligonucleotides.

#### Chapter six: structure of drug targets {-}

In target-based drug discovery, structural information of the target molecule is
essential. Its resolution and availability often determine how a project is
executed. Even for phenotypic drug discovery, structural information can be
helpful important because they may allow prediction of potential targets of the
drug candidate. 

For DNA and RNA targets, we will focus on thermodynamic modelling of DNA/RNA and
RNA/RNA interactions, which complements sequence-based analysis that we
introduced in the last chapter to predict efficacy and toxicity properties of
nucleotide-based therapies.

For protein targets, we will mainly focus on biophysical methods and underlying key
mathematical methods that determine 3D structures, structural databases, and
software tools to visualize and utilize them.

#### Chapter seven: structure-based modelling {-}

Structure-based modelling describes and predicts binding modes between a drug
candidate and its target(s). It is essential for target-based drug discovery
because the binding profile a drug candidate to its targets largely determine
its efficacy and safety profile. Modelling can be used jointly with
experiments to improve the molecule iteratively in order to make drugs with
higher affinity and better specificity. Besides, structure-based modelling
can be used for toxicity prediction and for virtual screening. In this chapter,
we examine its core concepts and selected applications.

#### Chapter eight: ligand-based modelling {-}

Complementary to structure-based modelling, ligand-based modelling uses
cheminformatics tools to describe chemical molecules and make predictions about
their properties. In this chapter, we highlight key concepts and approaches of
ligand-based modelling, its commonality with and differences from
structure-based modelling, and its applications in the drug-discovery process.

#### Chapter nine: antibody design {-}

Antibodies are proteins that bind to and modulate the function of other
proteins. Engineered human antibodies represent an important class of drugs. In
this chapter, we introduce key mathematical, statistical, and computational models that are
critical for therapeutic antibody design.

### Part II.II: Cellular modelling {-}

#### Chapter ten: network analysis {-}

Graph, or network, is an important mathematical model that links molecular-level
modelling with cellular and omics modelling. We examine selected deterministic
and probabilistic approaches of analysing chemical and biological networks and
their applications in drug discovery. 

We will focus on statistical methods, graph-theory-based methods, rule-based
methods, and methods based on either ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). 

#### Chapter eleven: DNA and RNA sequencing {-}

Genomics and transcriptomics studies with high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing
greatly expanded the ability of drug discovery scientists to both understand the
etiology of diseases and to assess the efficacy and safety liability profiles of
drug candidates. With the recent progress, it is even possible to profile DNA or RNA
molecules in a single cell or even its compartments such as nucleus.

We introduce the principles of the sequencing technology, discuss key concepts
and models to analyse the data, and examine their applications in drug
discovery. In particular, we will introduce single-cell sequencing technologies
and multimodal analysis, which holds promise to better understanding of disease
and efficacy and safety profiles of drug candidates.

#### Chapter twelve: proteomics and metabolomics {-}

Proteomics and metabolomics technologies find a wide range of applications in
drug discovery, from quantification of drug-target binding to accurate
determination of biomarkers. We introduce the principles of mass spectrometry
and flow cytometry, two mainly used technologies, practice of data analysis and
modelling, and their applications.

#### Chapter thirteen: biological imaging {-}

Biological imaging offers an orthogonal approach to omics technologies to
investigate biological processes and the effect of drug perturbation.
Application of imaging spans a wide range between molecule-level and organ- and
system-level modelling. 

Here we focus on cellular level imaging, in particular
high-content microscopy, with a particular emphasis on both non-supervised and
supervised approaches to analyse the imaging data.

### Part II.III: Organ and system-level modelling {-}

#### Chapter fourteen: introduction to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {-}

Pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling describes and predicts what the body to the drug.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling, on the other hand, describes and predicts what the drug does to the body.

We introduce the basic models of PK and PD modelling, including the
one-compartment PK model, the two-compartment PK model, and a joint PK-PD model.
We will examine how mathematical modelling and statistical data analysis help to
characterize PK and PD profile of drug candidates.

#### Chapter fifteen: physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling {-}

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling represents our knowledge of
human physiology in mathematical structures. It can be viewed as a natural
extension of the PK/PD models introduced in the last chapter. PBPK models are
applied for a wide range of purposes from animal-human translation and pediatric
dose selection. In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts and tools to
construct and analyse PBPK models.

#### Chapter sixteen: systems models {-}

Systems models offer an integrative approach to combine mechanistic preclinical
safety data with PK and patient-specific characteristics. They can assess safety
liabilities under different dosing regimens in different populations
quantitatively. They can also identify mechanisms underlying safety liabilities, which
may offer insight for compound optimisation.

In this chapter, we introduce principles and basic applications of system models
for safety and mechanism understanding with real-world examples.

### Part II.IV: population modelling and reverse translation {-}

#### Chapter seventeen: design of random clinical trials {-}

Random clinical trial is the golden-standard approach to examine efficacy and
safety profiles in patient population. In this chapter, we learn key concepts of
random clinical trials and their common forms. We will also learn the key
statistical considerations of designing a trial, including sample size,
statistical power, randomization scheme, and causality inference.

#### Chapter eighteen: population modelling {-}

Population modelling informs common trends and individual variabilities of drug
PK and PD profiles. It is used to infer associations between individual
variables (age, sex, genotype, *etc.*) and PK/PD profiles in clinical
pharmacology studies. We introduce the basic basic concepts of population
modelling, in particular non-linear mixed effect modelling.

#### Chapter nineteen: real-world data and reverse translation {-}

Real-world data is a collective term of data that are collected about patients,
their medical history, and other data types that can be potentially used to
infer efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Classically, real-world data and
clinical data are analysed 'for-purpose'. Recently, however,
researchers realise the potential to use such data to inform preclinical
discovery. We examine key modelling approaches used as well as both
opportunities and challenges.

### Part III: Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art and prospectives {-}

#### Chapter twenty: current multiscale-modelling practice in drug discovery {-}

We examine emerging patterns and iterative and integrated multiscale modelling in drug discovery. The
examples come from both academic and industrial research.

* Discovery of Vemurafenib
* Discovery of Sofosbuvir
* Discovery of Risdiplam
* Discovery of halicin as an antibiotics

#### Chapter twenty: outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery {-}

In the final chapter, we discuss the outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery. 

We will examine the potential of further developments at each individual levels.
On the molecular level, molecular simulation of longer time frames may reveal
rare and unexpected structures that are important for drug design. On the
cellular level, multimodal modelling is becoming a prominent tool to associate
different aspects of cellular biology and to integrate them into a unified view.
On the organ and system level, better models to simulate human physiology, such
as micro-physiological systems, and accumulation of data and knowledge makes it
more feasible to predict PK and PD profiles of drugs. Finally, the use of
digital biomarkers and the accumulation of data allows precision phenotyping of
patients and healthy individuals, creating both a wealthy data mine as well as
concerns about both its usefulness and privacy.

We list key open questions of bringing models at different levels and discuss
potential solutions. We study the success of multiscale modelling in two
scientific fields, molecular modelling and material science, and speculate how
drug discovery may learn and benefit from their approaches. Finally, we bring
forward a call for interdisciplinary modelling practice in drug discovery,
driven by computer-enhanced human cognition and communication, and
information-driven decision making with uncertainty.
