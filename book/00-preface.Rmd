# Preface {-}

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progress. Compared
with the long history of human diseases and both mythical and medical practices
to fight them, modern drug discovery has only a very short history since
somewhat 150 years. Nevertheless, it has fundamentally changed the life of human
being and its impact extends beyond demographics, economics, and culture. Today,
drug discovery is one of the most interdisciplinary and collaborative human
research enterprises. 

While early drug discovery is definitely driven by trial-and-errors in biology,
medicine, and chemistry, mathematical, statistical, and computational modelling
of data collected at multiple levels - molecular, cellular, individual, and
population levels - have played an ever more important role in discovering new
drugs and in finding new applications of existing drugs (known as *repurposing*
of the drug). The impact and potential of these quantitative sciences in drug
discovery is reflected in organization structures of pharmaceutical companies,
in research proposals raised by industrial-academic consortiums, in academic
publications, and last but not least, in drugs that would not exist without the
various modelling approaches.

This book introduces various modelling approaches that are indispensable to
modern drug discovery. The aim is to integrate modelling approaches at different
levels into a unified, *multiscale-modelling* view of quantitative aspects of
drug discovery.

## Targeted readership {-}

This book aims at providing undergraduate and graduate students from relevant
fields as well as drug-discovery researchers a practical introduction to basic
concepts and tools for data modelling and analysis in drug discovery.

Prerequisite is high-school knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
biology. Resources are provided in each chapter for self-learning of more
advanced (usually bachelor-level) knowledge. An appendix is available to refresh
the essential knowledge in mathematics, statistics, computer science, chemistry,
and biology that are used throughout the book.

### Part I: Introduction to drug discovery {-}

#### Chapter one: introduction to drug discovery {-}

We sketch a brief history of drug discovery, focusing especially on how
development of mathematical modelling, statistical methods, and computational
methods change our way to finding drugs. 

Having had an impression of road leading to where we are now, we will examine
three important features of drug discovery today that are relevant for later
chapters of the book, namely the choices between target-based and phenotypic
drug discovery, the balance between efficacy and toxicity, and drug modalities that are currently pursued.

#### Chapter two: the linear view of drug discovery {-}

The linear view of the drug discovery process can be found everywhere from
scientific publications to pharma companies' websites. In this chapter, we will examine the
linear view from multiple perspectives: how should we interpret
it? What is the time and cost associated with each stage of the linear view?
What are the advantages of disadvantages of the linear view of drug discovery?

Informed about the commonly used linear view of drug discovery, we are ready to
take a different view of it in the next chapter, namely the multiscale-modelling view.

#### Chapter three: the multiscale-modelling view of drug discovery {-}

Instead of thinking drug discovery as a linear process, we propose a multiscale
view where data are collected and mathematical, statistical, and computational
models are built at multiple levels: molecule-level, cellular level, system and
organ level, and last but not least, population level. Models at different
models are interconnected, informing and providing feedback to each other.

Similar to out study of the linear view, we will scrutinize and challenge the
multiscale modelling view as well: what are the advantages of disadvantages of
this view? What new insights can we gain by adopting this view? 

With the multiscale-modelling view as a mental model of the drug discovery
process, we will start our journey of learning principles, concepts, and tools
of modelling at individual levels. 

### Part II: Modelling at individual levels {-}

#### Part II.I: Molecular modelling {-}

Chapter four to six focus on molecular modelling of drug targets, including DNA,
protein and proteins. Chapter seven to nine go on introducing molecular modelling
of drug candidates and interactions with their targets.

#### Chapter four: the central dogma and drug targets {-}

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates the rules of information flow in
biological systems. It builds the foundation of drug discovery because drugs, in
order to treat diseases, must modulate components specified in the centra dogma.
We examine the central dogma, introduce its core components - DNA (genome), RNA
(transcriptome), and protein (proteome), and offer an overview of approved drugs
by their targets and their relationship with the central dogma.

#### Chapter five: biological sequence analysis {-}

DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis plays an important role in drug target
identification and assessment. We examine both deterministic and probabilistic
approaches to analyse biological sequences, represented by the Levenshtein
distance and (hidden) Markov chains. We discuss selected applications of
biological sequence analysis in the context of drug discovery, including
phylogenetic analysis and off-target prediction of oligonucleotides.

#### Chapter six: structure of drug targets {-}

In target-based drug discovery, high-quality structural information of the
target molecule is very valuable. Its availability can strongly determine how a
project is executed. Even for phenotypic drug discovery, structural information
is important because they may allow prediction of potential targets of the drug
candidate. 

For DNA and RNA targets, we will focus on thermodynamic modelling of DNA/RNA and
RNA/RNA interactions, which complements sequence-based analysis to predict
efficacy and toxicity properties of nucleotide-based therapies.

For proteins, we will mainly focus on biophysical methods and underlying key
mathematical methods that determine 3D structures, structural databases, and
software tools to visualize and utilize them.

#### Chapter seven: structure-based modelling {-}

Structure-based modelling is critical for drug discovery because it allows to
predict binding modes between a drug candidate and its targets and to
iteratively improve the molecule to make drugs with higher affinity and better
specificity. Beyond that, structure-based modelling can be used for toxicity
prediction and for virtual screening. In this chapter, we examine its core
concepts and selected applications.

#### Chapter eight: ligand-based modelling {-}

Complementary to structure-based modelling, ligand-based modelling uses
cheminformatics tools to describe chemical molecules, and make predictions about
their properties. In this chapter, we highlight key concepts and approaches of
ligand-based modelling, its commonality with and differences from
structure-based modelling.

#### Chapter nine: antibody design {-}

Antibodies are proteins that bind to and modulate the function of other
proteins. Engineered human antibodies represent an important class of drugs. In
this chapter, we introduce key mathematical and computational models that are
critical for therapeutic antibody design.

### Part II.II: Cellular modelling {-}

#### Chapter ten: network analysis {-}

Graph, or network, is an important mathematical model that links molecular-level
modelling with cellular and omics modelling. We examine selected deterministic
and probabilistic approaches of analysing chemical and biological networks and
their applications in drug discovery. 

We will focus on statistical methods, graph-theory-based methods, rule-based
methods, and methods based on either ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). 

#### Chapter eleven: DNA and RNA sequencing {-}

Genomics and transcriptomics studies with high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing
greatly expanded the ability of drug discovery scientists to both understand the
etiology of diseases and to assess the efficacy and safety liability profiles of
drug candidates. With the recent progress, it is even possible to profile DNA or RNA
molecules in a single cell or even its compartments such as nucleus.

We introduce the principles of the sequencing technology, discuss key concepts
and models to analyse the data, and examine their applications in drug
discovery.

#### Chapter twelve: proteomics and metabolomics {-}

Proteomics and metabolomics technologies find a wide range of applications in drug
discovery, from quantification of drug-target binding to accurate determination
of biomarkers. We introduce principles technology, practice of data analysis and
modelling, and their applications.

#### Chapter thirteen: biological imaging {-}

Biological imaging offers an orthogonal approach to omics technologies to
investigate biological processes and the effect of drug perturbation.
Application of imaging spans a wide range between molecule-level and organ- and
system-level modelling. Here we focus on cellular level imaging, in particular
high-content microscopy, with a particular emphasis on both non-supervised and
supervised approaches to analyse the imaging the data.

### Part II.III: Organ and system-level modelling {-}

#### Chapter fourteen: introduction to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {-}

Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling describes what the body
does to the drug, and what the drug does to the body, respectively. We introduce
the basic models, including the one-compartment PK model, the two-compartment
PK model, and a PK-PD model. We will examine how
mathematical modelling and statistical data analysis help to characterize PK and
PD profile of drug candidates.

#### Chapter fifteen: physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling {-}

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling represents our knowledge of
human physiology in mathematical structures. It can be viewed as a natural
extension of the PK/PD models introduced in the last chapter. PBPK models are
applied for a wide range of purposes from animal-human translation and pediatric
dose selection. In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts and tools to
construct and analyse PBPK models.

#### Chapter sixteen: systems models {-}

Systems models offer an integrative approach to combine mechanistic preclinical
safety data with PK and patient-specific characteristics. They can assess safety
liabilities under different dosing regimens in different populations
quantitatively. They can also identify mechanisms underlying liabilities, which
may offer insight for compound optimisation.

### Part II.IV: population modelling and reverse translation {-}

#### Chapter seventeen: design of random clinical trials {-}

Random clinical trial is the golden-standard approach to examine efficacy and
safety profiles in patient population. We introduce key concepts of random
clinical trials and consider key elements of a trial, including sample size,
statistical power, randomization scheme, and causality inference.

#### Chapter eighteen: population modelling {-}

Population modelling informs common trends and individual variabilities of drug
PK and PD profiles. It is used to infer associations between individual
variables (age, sex, genotype, *etc.*) and PK/PD profiles in clinical
pharmacology studies. We introduce the basic basic concepts of population
modelling, in particular non-linear mixed effect modelling.

#### Chapter nineteen: real-world data and reverse translation {-}

Real-world data is a collective term of data that are collected about patients,
their medical history, and other data types that can be potentially used to
infer efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Classically, real-world data and
clinical data are analysed in a 'for-purpose' fashion. Recently, however,
researchers realise the potential to use such data to inform preclinical
discovery. We examine key modelling approaches used as well as both
opportunities and challenges.

### Part III: Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art and prospectives {-}

#### Chapter twenty: current multiscale-modelling practice in drug discovery {-}

We examine emerging patterns and iterative and integrated modelling. The
examples come from both academic and industrial research.

* Discovery of Sofosbuvir
* Discovery of Vemurafenib
* Discovery of Risdiplam
* Discovery of halicin as an antibiotics

#### Chapter twenty: outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery {-}

In the last chapter, we discuss the outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery. 

We will examine the potential of further developments at each individual levels. On the molecular level, molecular simulation of longer time frames may reveal rare and unexpected structures that are important for drug design. On the cellular level, multimodal modelling is becoming a prominent tool to associate different aspects of cellular biology and to integrate them into a unified view. On the organ and system level, better models to simulate human physiology, such as micro-physiological systems, and accumulation of data and knowledge makes it more feasible to predict PK and PD profiles of drugs. Last but not least, the use of digital biomarkers and the accumulation of data allows precision phenotyping of patients and healthy individuals, creating both a wealthy data mine as well as privacy concerns.

We list key open questions of bringing models at different levels and discuss potential solutions. We study the success of multiscale modelling in two scientific fields, molecular modelling and material science, and speculate how drug discovery may learn and benefit from their approaches. Finally, we bring forward a call for interdisciplinary modelling practice in drug discovery, driven by computer-enhanced human cognition and communication, and information-driven decision making with uncertainty.
