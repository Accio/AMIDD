# Preface {-}

This document is the preface to *Multiscale Modelling in Drug Discovery*
(working title), a book that I am writing. 

## Modelling in drug discovery

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progression. Modern
drug discovery has a much shorter history compared with the history of human and
human diseases. It has, however, fundamentally changed the life of each of us. 

It has also changed itself during its development. In its early years, drug
discovery was primarily driven by serendipity and trial-and-errors in chemistry,
biology, and medicine. Today, drug discovery represents one of the most
interdisciplinary and collaborative human research enterprises. As the
techniques of drug discovery developed and refined, mathematical, statistical,
and computational models have become essential besides experimental
methods.

We apply these models mainly for two reasons. First, they help us study the
human body as a biochemical system. Since the system is large and complex, we
usually consider part of it. Examples of such sub-systems include the brain
suffering from the Alzheimer's Disease, the lung infected by the coronavirus,
and a melanoma tissue, a skin cancer that originates from pigment-producing
cells known as melanocytes. From this perspective, health and diseases are
considered as the states of the system. Mathematical, statistical, and
computational models are used to characterize the different states: what
variables are correlated with the states? Which variables are causal,
manipulating of which may worsen or cure the disease? For simplicity, we say
that models serve *disease understanding* in such contexts.

The other application of mathematical, statistical, and computational models is
to characterize drug-body interactions. From a system's perspective, the goal
of drug discovery is to identify a perturbation or a combination of
perturbations that switches the state of the sub-system from 'disease' to
'health', while causing as little harm as possible to the whole system.

The capacity of a drug to switch the state of a sub-system from 'disease' to
'health' is defined as its *efficacy profile*. Its capacity of causing harm,
known as *adverse effects*, to the whole system is defined as its *toxicity
profile*. Equivalently, its capacity of not causing adverse effects is its
*safety profile*. Therefore, models also reveal *efficacy and safety profiles*
of drug candidates.

It is obvious that the two types of applications are dependent on each other: a
better understanding of the disease may catalyse the discovery of new drugs with
better efficacy and safety profiles. The study of drug-body interactions does
not only provide chemical or biological tools to treat diseases. The tools can
be used as perturbations to investigate biological systems, either in the
healthy state or in disease states. Such studies may reveal unexpected aspects
of the disease or even fundamental biology.

In summary, modern drug discovery can be thought of as an iterative process
consisting of experiments and modelling. The starting point consists of a
disease that we wish to cure and some biological or chemical entities that we
deem as appropriate prototypes of drug candidates. We collect data of the
disease and data of drug candidates from experiments. Models characterize
diseases as states of the system and encode our understanding of drug-body
interactions. Informed by these models, we find ways to improve the efficacy
and safety profile of our molecules and use our expertise in chemistry and
biology to make the changes. In the next cycle, more experiments further refine
the drug candidate, and improved models update our belief about
how the molecule interacts with the body. The process is repeated until a drug
with desired efficacy and safety profiles is found. 

This book introduces basic concepts, principles and selected tools of
mathematical, statistical, and computational modelling for disease
understanding and for efficacy and safety profiling of drug candidates. The aim
is to integrate diverse modelling approaches at different levels into a unified,
*multiscale-modelling* view of drug discovery.

## The target audience {-}

This book aims at providing undergraduate students of mathematics, computer
sciences and natural sciences with an application-oriented introduction to drug
discovery. It can also be used by researchers working on understanding and drug
discovery as a practical guide to mathematical, statistical, and computational
modelling.

Prerequisite is high-school knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
biology. Resources are provided for self-learning of more advanced (usually
bachelor-level) knowledge in each chapter. An appendix is available to refresh
the essential knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and programming that is used
throughout the book.

## Organization of the book {-}

The content of the book is organized in three parts:

1. Introduction to modern drug discovery
2. Modelling at individual levels
    1. Molecule-level modelling
    2. Cell-level modelling
    3. Organ- and system-level modelling
    4. Population modelling
3. Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art practice and prospects

### Part I: Introduction to modern drug discovery {-}

#### Chapter One: Past and Present of Drug Discovery {-}

We sketch a brief history of drug discovery, focusing especially on how
development of mathematical models, statistical methods, and computational
tools change our way of finding drugs. 

We next examine three basic but important concepts of drug discovery that
are relevant for later chapters:

1. the choice between target-based and phenotypic drug discovery,
2. the balance between efficacy and safety, and 
3. drug modalities, such as small molecules, antibodies, oligonucleotides,
   vaccines, *etc.*

#### Chapter Two: The Linear View of Drug Discovery {-}

The linear view of drug discovery is prevalent. It is found everywhere from
scientific publications to pharma companies' websites. In this chapter, we will
examine it from three perspectives: how can we interpret it? What is the time
and cost associated with each stage in the linear view? What are the advantages
and disadvantages of such a view?

Once we are familiar with the linear view, we are ready to take an alternative,
*multiscale-modelling* perspective in the next chapter. It may help us better
understand some aspects of drug discovery.

#### Chapter Three: the multiscale-modelling view of drug discovery {-}

We examine models constructed at multiple levels, including molecule-level
models, cell-level models, system- and organ-level models, and population-level
models. Models at different models are interconnected, informing and providing
feedback to each other.

We will scrutinize and challenge the multiscale-modelling view: what are its advantages and disadvantages compared with the linear view? What new insights can it bring us?

### Part II: Modelling at individual levels {-}

With multiscale modelling as a mental model of drug discovery, we start our
journey of learning basic concepts, principles, and tools of modelling at
individual levels.

#### Part II.I: Molecular Modelling {-}

Chapter four to six focus on molecular modelling of drug targets, including DNA,
protein and proteins. Chapter seven to nine go on introducing molecular
modelling of drug candidates and their interactions with targets.

#### Chapter Four: The Central Dogma and Drug Targets {-}

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates the rule of information flow in
biological systems. It builds the molecular foundation of drug discovery because
drugs, in order to treat diseases, must interact with and modulate components
specified in the central dogma.

We will learn how biological information is stored in and transferred between
DNA (the building blocks of the genome), RNA (the building blocks of the
transcriptome), and protein (the building blocks of the proteome). We will also
examine approved drugs by their targets in the context of the central dogma.

#### Chapter Five: Biological Sequence Analysis {-}

DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis plays an important role in drug target
identification and assessment. We introduce both deterministic
and probabilistic approaches to biological sequences analysis, using the
Levenshtein distance, dynamic programming, and (hidden) Markov chains as
examples.

We also discuss applications of biological sequence analysis in drug discovery,
including phylogenetic analysis and off-target prediction of oligonucleotides.

#### Chapter Six: Structure of Drug Targets {-}

In target-based drug discovery, structural information of the target is
critical. Its resolution and availability often determine how a discovery
project is designed and executed. Even for phenotypic discovery projects,
structural information can be helpful because it may allow the prediction of
potential targets and off-targets of the drug candidate. 

For DNA and RNA targets, we focus on the thermodynamic modelling of DNA/RNA and
RNA/RNA interactions. It complements sequence analysis introduced in the last
chapter to predict efficacy and safety properties of nucleotide-based
therapeutics.

For protein targets, we introduce computational and biophysical methods commonly
used to determine 3D structures, including homology modelling, X-ray
crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM). We highlight key mathematical and computational methods underlying
these methods. Finally, we introduce databases and software tools to store,
visualize, and use structural information. 

#### Chapter Seven: Structure-based Modelling {-}

Structure-based modelling describes and predicts binding modes between a drug
candidate and its target (or targets). It is essential for target-based drug
discovery because the binding profile largely determines the efficacy and safety
profiles of a molecule. Structure-based modelling and experiments complement and
inform each other to improve the affinity and specificity of the molecule
iteratively. Here we examine core concepts and techniques of structure-based
modelling, as well as further applications including toxicity prediction and
virtual screening.

#### Chapter Eight: ligand-based modelling {-}

Complementary to structure-based modelling, ligand-based modelling uses
cheminformatics tools to describe chemical molecules and make predictions about
their physicochemical and biological properties. We highlight the key concepts and
approaches to ligand-based modelling, its commonality with and differences from
structure-based modelling, and its applications in drug discovery.

#### Chapter Nine: antibody design {-}

Antibodies are proteins that bind to and modulate the function of other
proteins. Engineered human antibodies represent an important class of drugs. WE
introduce key mathematical, statistical, and computational models that are
critical for therapeutic antibody design.

### Part II.II: Cellular modelling {-}

#### Chapter Ten: Network Analysis {-}

Graph, or network, is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect
them. It is an important mathematical model that links molecular-level modelling
with cellular modelling. We examine selected deterministic and probabilistic
approaches of chemical and biological networks analysis. Examples include
statistical methods, graph-theory-based methods, rule-based methods, and methods
based on either ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). 

#### Chapter Eleven: DNA- and RNA-Sequencing {-}

Genomics and transcriptomics studies with high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing
greatly expanded our ability to understand diseases. They are also used to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of drug
candidates. With the recent progress, it is even possible to profile DNA or RNA
molecules in a single cell or even in sub-compartments such as the nucleus.

We introduce the principles of sequencing technologies, discuss key concepts
and models to analyse the data, and examine their applications in drug
discovery. In particular, we will introduce single-cell sequencing technologies
and multimodal analysis, which hold promise for knowledge about diseases and
drug-body interaction on the level of individual cells and interactions between the cells.

#### Chapter Twelve: Proteomics and Metabolomics {-}

Proteomics and metabolomics technologies find a wide range of applications in
drug discovery, from quantification of drug-target binding to accurate
determination of biomarkers. We introduce the principles of two widely used technologies, mass spectrometry and flow cytometry. We examine the practice of data analysis and modelling. Finally, we discuss the applications of proteomics and metabolomics in drug discovery.

#### Chapter Thirteen: Biological Imaging {-}

Biological imaging offers an orthogonal approach to omics technologies
introduced in the last two chapters to
investigate biological processes and the effect of drug perturbation.
Application of imaging spans a wide range between molecular modelling and population modelling. 

First, we give a brief overview of imaging technologies used in drug discovery.
Next, we focus on cellular level imaging, in particular high-content microscopy.
We introduce both non-supervised and supervised methods of biological imaging
data analysis.

### Part II.III: Organ- And System-level Modelling {-}

#### Chapter Fourteen: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {-}

Pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling describes and predicts what the body does to the
drug. Pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling, on the other hand, describes and predicts
what the drug does to the body.

We introduce the basic models of PK and PD modelling, including a
one-compartment PK model, a two-compartment PK model, and a joint PK-PD model.
We examine how mathematical modelling and statistical data analysis help to
characterize the PK and the PD profile of drug candidates.

#### Chapter Fifteen: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling {-}

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling represents our knowledge
of human physiology in mathematical structures. It can be seen as a natural
extension of the PK and PD models introduced in the last chapter. PBPK models
are applied for a wide range of purposes from animal-human translation to
paediatric dose selection. 

We introduce the basic concepts and principles of PBPK modelling and tools to
construct and analyse the models.

#### Chapter Sixteen: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Models {-}

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models, or systems models for short,
offer an integrative approach to combine mechanistic preclinical safety data
with PK and patient-specific characteristics. They can identify mechanisms of
actions of drugs, which may offer insight for compound optimization or may even
propose new targets. They can also assess safety liabilities under different
dosing regimens in different populations quantitatively.

We introduce principles and basic applications of system models for safety and
for mechanism-of-action understanding. We will also examine real systems models
developed in drug discovery and development projects.

### Part II.IV: Population Modelling And Reverse Translation {-}

#### Chapter Seventeen: Randomized Controlled Trials {-}

Randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard of measuring the
effectiveness of an intervention or a treatment. It is used in drug discovery
and development to examine the efficacy and safety profiles of a drug in a
defined patient population. In this chapter, we learn key concepts and
principles of designing a randomized controlled trial, including statistical
power calculation, randomization, blinding, and causality inference. We will
also examine the common forms of RCT in drug discovery.

#### Chapter Eighteen: Population Modelling {-}

Population modelling informs common trends and individual variabilities of PK
and PD profiles of a drug. It is used to infer associations between individual
variables (age, sex, genotype, *etc.*) and PK/PD profiles in clinical
pharmacology. We introduce the basic concepts of population modelling, in
particular the statistical technique that is known as non-linear mixed-effect
modelling.

#### Chapter Nineteen: Real-World Data and Reverse Translation {-}

Real-World Data (RWD) refers to data is collected about patients, including the
personal data, omics data, medical records, and other data types that can be
potentially used to infer efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Classically,
real-world data, like clinical-trial data, are analysed 'for-purpose', namely to
serve the development of the particular drug product for which the data were
collected. Recently, however, researchers realize the potential of such data to
inform preclinical discovery, which is summarized in the term *reverse
translation*. We examine key modelling approaches used as well as both
opportunities and challenges of reverse translation.

### Part III: Multiscale Modelling: State-of-the-art and Prospects {-}

#### Chapter Twenty: Examples of Multiscale Modelling in Drug Discovery {-}

We examine emerging patterns of multiscale modelling in drug discovery with
examples available in patents and publications. They come from both industrial and academic research.

* Discovery of Vemurafenib
* Discovery of Sofosbuvir
* Discovery of Risdiplam
* Discovery of halicin as an antibiotics

#### Chapter Twenty-one: Outlook of Multiscale Modelling in Drug Discovery {-}

In the final chapter, we discuss the outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery. 

We first discuss future developments at individual levels.

* On the molecular level, molecular simulation of longer time frames may reveal
  rare and unexpected structures that are important for drug design.
* On the cellular level, multimodal analysis is becoming a prominent tool to
  associate different aspects of cellular biology and to integrate them into a
  unified view.
* On the organ and system level, better models to simulate human physiology,
  such as micro-physiological systems, will allow better predict PK and PD
  profiles. Accumulation of patient-specific data and knowledge of
  genotype-phenotype association will allow individualized dosing.
* On the population level, digital biomarkers and integration of genotype and
  phenotype data allow continuous and non-invasive characterization of response
  to drugs. 

We list key open questions of bringing models at different levels and discuss
potential solutions. We study the success of multiscale modelling in other two
scientific fields, molecular modelling in chemistry and material science in
physics, and speculate how drug discovery may learn and benefit from their
approaches. 

Finally, we consider how interdisciplinary multiscale modelling may shape drug
discovery in the future. We focus on two aspects: computer-enhanced human
cognition and collaboration, uncertainty- and risk-aware decision-making.
Mathematical, statistical, and computational models, when unified and
integrated, may help us identify, build, and test better drug-like molecules faster and
cheaper. They may also help us make better decisions that are optimized given
facts, uncertainty and risk. If implemented, these measures may revolutionize
the way we discover drugs in the future.
