## Modelling in drug discovery

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progression. Modern
drug discovery has a much shorter history compared with the history of human and
human diseases. It has, however, fundamentally changed the life of each of us. 

Today, drug discovery represents one of the most interdisciplinary and
collaborative human research enterprises. Drug discovery in its early years was
primarily driven by trial-and-errors in chemistry, biology, and medicine. As the
techniques of drug discovery developed and refined, mathematical, statistical,
and computational modelling has become essential besides experimental
approaches. 

We apply these models mainly for two reasons. First, they help us study human
body as a biochemical system. Since the system is large and complex, we usually
consider part of it. Example of such sub-systems include the lung infected by the corona virus, and a melanoma tissue, a type of skin cancer that originate from pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. From this perspective, health and
diseases are treated as the states of the system. Mathematical, statistical, and
computational models are used to characterize the different states of the
system: what variables are correlated with the states? Which
variables are causal, manipulating of which may worsen or cure the
disease? For simplicity, we say that models serve *disease understanding* in
such contexts.

The other application of mathematical, statistical, and computational models is
to characterize drug-body interactions. From our systems perspective, the goal
of drug discovery is to identify a perturbation, or a combination of
perturbations, that switches the state of the sub-system from 'disease' to
'health', while causing as little harm,  known as *adverse effects*, as possible to the whole system.

The capacity of a drug to switch the state of a sub-system from 'disease' to
'health' is defined as its *efficacy*. Its capacity of causing adverse
effects to the whole system is defined as its *safety*. Therefore, models also
reveal *efficacy and safety profiles* of drug candidates.

Data of drug-body interactions are collected at multiple scales. We can roughly
classify them into molecular data, cellular data, organ- and system-level data,
and population data. Interpretation of models at individual levels and
integration of the results across the hierarchies allow us to make key
decisions, such as which drug target to work on or which molecule to test in
human.

It is obvious that the two types of applications are dependent on each other: a
better understanding of the disease may catalyse the discovery of new drugs with
better efficacy and safety profiles. The study of drug-body interactions does
not only provide chemical or biological tools to treat diseases. The tools can
be used as perturbations to investigate biological systems, either in the
healthy state or in disease states. Such studies may reveal unexpected aspects
of the disease or even fundamental biology.

In summary, drug discovery can be viewed as an iterative process consisting of
experiments and modelling. The starting point consists of a disease that we wish
to cure and some biological or chemical entities that we deem as appropriate
prototypes of drug candidates. We collect data of the disease and of drug
candidates from experiments. Models characterize diseases as states of the
system and encode our understanding of drug-body interactions. Informed by these
models, we use our expertise in chemistry and biology to modify the drug
candidate to improve its efficacy and safety profile. In the next cycle, more
experiments further refine the drug candidate and we construct improved models
to update our belief about how the molecule interacts with the body. The process
is repeated until a drug with desired efficacy and safety profiles is found. 

This book introduces basic concepts, principles and selected tools of
mathematical, statistical, and computational modelling approaches to disease
understanding and to efficacy and safety profiling of drug candidates. The aim
is to integrate diverse modelling approaches at different levels into a unified,
*multiscale-modelling* view of drug discovery.

## The target audience {-}

This book aims at providing undergraduate and graduate students from relevant
fields (mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry,
pharmacology, *etc.*) an application-oriented introduction to drug discovery
from the modelling perspective. It can also be used by researchers
working in the fields of disease understanding and drug discovery as a practical
guide to modelling.

Prerequisite is high-school knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
biology. Resources are provided in each chapter for self-learning of more
advanced (usually bachelor-level) knowledge. An appendix is available to refresh
the essential knowledge in mathematics, statistics, chemistry, and biology that
is used throughout the book.

## Organization of the book {-}

The content of the book is organised in three parts:

1. Introduction to modern drug discovery
2. Modelling at individual levels
    1. Molecule-level modelling
    2. Cell-level modelling
    3. Organ- and system-level modelling
    4. Population modelling
3. Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art practice and prospectives

### Part I: Introduction to modern drug discovery {-}

#### Chapter One: introduction to drug discovery {-}

We sketch a brief history of drug discovery, focusing especially on how
development of mathematical modelling, statistical methods, and computational
tools change our way of finding drugs. 

We will next examine three basic but important concepts of drug discovery hat
are relevant for later chapters of the book, namely:

1. the choice between target-based and phenotypic drug discovery,
2. the balance between efficacy and safety, and 
3. drug modalities, such as small molecules, antibodies, oligonucleotides,
   vaccines, *etc.*

#### Chapter Two: the linear view of drug discovery {-}

The linear view of drug discovery is prevalent. It is found
everywhere from scientific publications to pharma companies' websites. In this
chapter, we will examine it from three perspectives: how can we interpret it?
What is the time and cost associated with each stage in the linear view? What
are the advantages and disadvantages of such a view?

Once we are familiar with the linear view, we are ready to take an alternative,
multiscale-modelling perspective in the next chapter. It may help us better
understand some aspects of drug discovery.

#### Chapter Three: the multiscale-modelling view of drug discovery {-}

In this chapter, we examine the multiscale view of drug discovery. We examine
models constructed at multiple levels in drug discovery, including
molecular-level, cellular-level, system- and organ-level, and population-level
models. Models at different models are interconnected, informing and providing
feedback to each other.

We will scrutinize and challenge the multiscale-modelling view: what are its advantages and disadvantages? What new insights can it bring to us?

With multiscale modelling as a mental model of drug discovery, we start in
Part II of the book our journey of learning basic concepts, principles, and tools of modelling at individual levels.

### Part II: Modelling at individual levels {-}

#### Part II.I: Molecular modelling {-}

Chapter four to six focus on molecular modelling of drug targets, including DNA,
protein and proteins. Chapter seven to nine go on introducing molecular
modelling of drug candidates and their interactions with targets.

#### Chapter Four: the central dogma and drug targets {-}

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates the rule of information flow in
biological systems. It builds the foundation of drug discovery because drugs, in
order to treat diseases, must modulate components specified in the centra dogma.

We will learn how biological information is stored in and transferred between
DNA (the building blocks of the genome), RNA (the building blocks of the
transcriptome), and protein (the building blocks of the proteome). We will also
examine approved drugs by their targets and their relationship with the central
dogma.

#### Chapter Five: biological sequence analysis {-}

DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis plays an important role in drug target
identification and assessment. In this chapter, We introduce both deterministic
and probabilistic approaches to analyse biological sequences, including the
Levenshtein distance, dynamic programming, and (hidden) Markov chains.

We also discuss applications of biological sequence analysis in the context of
drug discovery, including phylogenetic analysis and off-target prediction of
oligonucleotides.

#### Chapter Six: structure of drug targets {-}

In target-based drug discovery, structural information of the target is
essential. Its resolution and availability often determine how a discovery
project is designed and executed. Even for phenotypic discovery projects,
structural information can be helpful because they may allow prediction of
potential targets and off-targets of the drug candidate. 

For DNA and RNA targets, we will focus on thermodynamic modelling of DNA/RNA and
RNA/RNA interactions, which complements sequence-based analysis that we
introduced in the last chapter to predict efficacy and safety properties of
nucleotide-based therapies.

For protein targets, we will introduce computational and biophysical methods commonly used to determine 3D structures, including homology modelling, X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We highlight key mathematical and computational methods underlying these methods. Finally, we introduce databases and software tools to store, visualize, and use structural information. 

#### Chapter Seven: structure-based modelling {-}

Structure-based modelling describes and predicts binding modes between a drug
candidate and its target (or targets). It is essential for target-based drug
discovery because the binding profile largely determine the efficacy and safety
properties of a molecule. Modelling can be used jointly with experiments to
improve the molecule iteratively in order to make drugs with higher affinity and
better specificity. Besides, structure-based modelling can be used for toxicity
prediction and for virtual screening. In this chapter, we examine its core
concepts and selected applications.

#### Chapter Eight: ligand-based modelling {-}

Complementary to structure-based modelling, ligand-based modelling uses
cheminformatics tools to describe chemical molecules and make predictions about
their properties. In this chapter, we highlight key concepts and approaches of
ligand-based modelling, its commonality with and differences from
structure-based modelling, and its applications in drug discovery.

#### Chapter Nine: antibody design {-}

Antibodies are proteins that bind to and modulate the function of other
proteins. Engineered human antibodies represent an important class of drugs. In
this chapter, we introduce key mathematical, statistical, and computational models that are
critical for therapeutic antibody design.

### Part II.II: Cellular modelling {-}

#### Chapter Ten: network analysis {-}

Graph, or network, is an important mathematical model that links molecular-level
modelling with cellular and omics modelling. We examine selected deterministic
and probabilistic approaches of analysing chemical and biological networks and
their applications in drug discovery. 

We will focus on statistical methods, graph-theory-based methods, rule-based
methods, and methods based on either ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). 

#### Chapter Eleven: DNA and RNA sequencing {-}

Genomics and transcriptomics studies with high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing
greatly expanded the ability of researchers to understand the etiology of
diseases. They are also used to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of drug
candidates. With the recent progress, it is even possible to profile DNA or RNA
molecules in a single cell or even in sub-compartments such as the nucleus.

We introduce the principles of the sequencing technology, discuss key concepts
and models to analyse the data, and examine their applications in drug
discovery. In particular, we will introduce single-cell sequencing technologies
and multimodal analysis, which holds promise to better disease understanding
and efficacy and safety profiling on the cellular level.

#### Chapter Twelve: proteomics and metabolomics {-}

Proteomics and metabolomics technologies find a wide range of applications in
drug discovery, from quantification of drug-target binding to accurate
determination of biomarkers. We introduce the principles of two widely used technologies, mass spectrometry and flow cytometry. We examine the practice of data analysis and modelling. Finally, we discuss the applications of proteomics and metabolomics in drug discovery.

#### Chapter Thirteen: biological imaging {-}

Biological imaging offers an orthogonal approach to omics technologies to
investigate biological processes and the effect of drug perturbation.
Application of imaging spans a wide range between molecular modelling and population modelling. 

Here we focus on cellular level imaging, in particular high-content microscopy,
with a particular emphasis on both non-supervised and supervised approaches to
analyse the imaging data.

### Part II.III: Organ and system-level modelling {-}

#### Chapter Fourteen: introduction to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {-}

Pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling describes and predicts what the body does to the
drug.  Pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling, on the other hand, describes and predicts
what the drug does to the body.

We introduce the basic models of PK and PD modelling, including the
one-compartment PK model, the two-compartment PK model, and a joint PK-PD model.
We will examine how mathematical modelling and statistical data analysis help to
characterize PK and PD profile of drug candidates.

#### Chapter Fifteen: physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling {-}

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK) represents our knowledge
of human physiology in mathematical structures. It can be viewed as a natural
extension of the PK/PD models introduced in the last chapter. PBPK models are
applied for a wide range of purposes from animal-human translation and pediatric
dose selection. In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts and tools to
construct and analyse PBPK models.

#### Chapter Sixteen: systems models {-}

Systems models offer an integrative approach to combine mechanistic preclinical
safety data with PK and patient-specific characteristics. They can assess safety
liabilities under different dosing regimens in different populations
quantitatively. They can also identify mechanisms underlying safety liabilities,
which may offer insight for compound optimisation.

In this chapter, we introduce principles and basic applications of system models
for safety and mechanism understanding with real-world examples.

### Part II.IV: population modelling and reverse translation {-}

#### Chapter Seventeen: design of random clinical trials {-}

Random clinical trial is the golden-standard approach to examine the efficacy
and safety profiles of a drug in a defined patient population. In this chapter,
we learn key concepts of random clinical trials and their common forms. We will
also learn the key statistical considerations of designing a trial, including
sample size, statistical power, randomization scheme, and causality inference.

#### Chapter Eighteen: population modelling {-}

Population modelling informs common trends and individual variabilities of drug
PK and PD profiles. It is used to infer associations between individual
variables (age, sex, genotype, *etc.*) and PK/PD profiles in clinical
pharmacology. We introduce the basic concepts of population
modelling, in particular non-linear mixed effect modelling.

#### Chapter Nineteen: real-world data and reverse translation {-}

Real-world data is a collective term of data that are collected about patients,
including the personal data, omics data, medical records, and other data types
that can be potentially used to infer efficacy and safety profiles of drugs.
Classically, real-world data and clinical data are analysed 'for-purpose',
namely to serve the clinical trial and development of the particular drug
product for which the data were collected. Recently, however, researchers
realise the potential of such data to inform preclinical discovery. We
examine key modelling approaches used as well as both opportunities and
challenges.

### Part III: Multiscale modelling: state-of-the-art and prospectives {-}

#### Chapter Twenty: examples of multiscale modelling in drug discovery {-}

We examine emerging patterns of multiscale modelling in drug discovery. The
examples come from both industrial and academic research.

* Discovery of Vemurafenib
* Discovery of Sofosbuvir
* Discovery of Risdiplam
* Discovery of halicin as an antibiotics

#### Chapter Twenty-one: outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery {-}

In the final chapter, we discuss the outlook of multiscale modelling in drug discovery. 

We will examine the potential of future developments at each individual levels.

* On the molecular level, molecular simulation of longer time frames may reveal
  rare and unexpected structures that are important for drug design.
* On the cellular level, multimodal modelling is becoming a prominent tool to
  associate different aspects of cellular biology and to integrate them into a
  unified view.
* On the organ and system level, better models to simulate human physiology,
  such as micro-physiological systems, and accumulation of data and knowledge
  makes it more feasible to predict PK and PD profiles of drugs.
* On the population level, the use of digital biomarkers and the accumulation of
  data allows precision phenotyping of patients and healthy individuals,
  creating both a wealthy data mine as well as concerns about both its
  usefulness and privacy.

We list key open questions of bringing models at different levels and discuss
potential solutions. We study the success of multiscale modelling in two
scientific fields, molecular modelling and material science, and speculate how
drug discovery may learn and benefit from their approaches. 

Finally, we bring forward a call for interdisciplinary modelling practice in drug discovery. We foresee that progress in computer-enhanced human cognition and collaboration, and uncertainty- and risk-aware decision making as key areas where mathematical, statistical, and computational models can make additional impact on future drug discovery.
