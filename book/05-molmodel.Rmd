# Encoding and similarity search of chemical structures {#cheminfo}

## What do we want to achieve today

* Have a high-level understanding of encoding chemical structures and similarity search
* Know technical terms such as SMILEs, INCHI keys, fingerprint, Tanimoto Index
* Know how Tanimoto Index is applied to fingerprint-based chemical structure search
* Know how graph edit distance is mathematically defined and used to search for similar molecules
