# Genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics {#omics}

## What we want to achieve today

* Understand the basics of omics technologies, especially in the light of central dogma and biological sequence analysis
* Know technical terms including De Bruijn graphs, Burrows-Wheeler transformation
* Have a first understanding of graph models with the example of RSEM
* Have a first understanding of linear models and generalised linear models with the example of edgeR

We describe applications of omics in disease understanding and drug discovery, especially in the light of underlying mathematical concepts.

## Background information

### Principles of DNA and RNA sequencing

Sanger sequencing represents the first generation of DNA sequencing technique.

Second generation sequencing, sometimes called next-generation sequencing, comes in several variants. One variant is Illumina sequencing, sometimes known as sequencing by synthesis. DNA sequences to be sequenced, together with ingridients that are required for the synthesis, such as enyzmes, are dispersed into droplets. These seqeunces can be potentially modified, for instance, with the addition of a short strech of artificial nucleotides as *barcodes*. In each round of synthesis, a nucleotide is added to the newly synthesised strand. The addition of the nucleotide is detected by sensors that recognize nucleotides based on their illuminant modifications. A camera takes pictures of thousands of droplets and image analysis is used to read the nucleotide added at each step. At the end of the sequencing process, the nucleotide sequence of the original template is constructed by concatenateing the detected nucleotides together. They are saved in FASTQ files.

A variant is not to sequence the whole stretch of the template, but rather only the two ends of it. This will give pair-end (PE) reads.

RNA can be reverse trascribed into DNA. Therefore RNAs can be sequenced just as DNAs, with the difference that uracil (*U*) replaces thymine (*T*).

### Genomics

The genetic information, for instance DNA sequence in our genomes, varies between species, between individuals, and between different cells in our body. 

Chimpanzees and human share 96% identical DNA sequences in their genomes. Mice and human share 85% and 50% identical DNA sequences in protein-coding and non-coding regions. 

Between human individuals, 99.9% DNA sequences are identical. This means that out of six billion DNA bases in somatic cells, about a few million bases are different.

How about DNA variations between cells in a human body?
