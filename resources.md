Resources used to prepare for the course
===

I would like to acknowledge the creators for all the great material that helped me organising the content of the course, especially those open-source, open-access material. They contribute in my opinion to the benefit of the humanity.

Below are the key resources that I used. Individual papers and book chapters are cited *in situ*.

# Mathematical foundations

* Linear algebra
  * MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) course by Gilbert Strang
  * Essence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown
* Calculus
* Probability theory and statistics
  * Pattern recognition and machine learning by M. Bishop

# Drug discovery in general

* Medicinal Chemistry: The Molecular Basis of Drug Discovery (Davidson: D001x) on edX
* [Design and Analysis of Clinical Trails](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/education/university-of-gothenburg/courses/mathematical-statistics/Pages/msa620.aspx)

# Drug discovery from the perspectives of patients and their relatives

* [CureFFI.org](http://www.cureffi.org/), by Eric Vallabh Minikel and his wife Sonia Vallabh [who are 'patient-scientists'](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/sonia-vallabh). I personally believe that what they do represents well how drug discovery should work - driven by a strong motivation and passion, enabled by a wide knowledge in biology, chemistry, and quantitative sciences including mathematics and informatics, and catalysed by ever deeper understanding of the complex biological system. Consider a [donation](http://www.cureffi.org/donate/) if you care about prion diseases.
* [Tomorrow Edition](https://tmrwedition.com/) by Ben Stecher, a patient of Parkinson's Disease. His series [The Search For A Cure](https://tmrwedition.com/2018/11/14/the-search-for-a-cure-part-1-back-to-the-future/) is a great source of introduction to efforts of the human being to identify disease treatments, including drug discovery.
