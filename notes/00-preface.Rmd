# Preface {-}

Drug discovery is the activity of identifying chemical or biological entities
that potentially slow down, halt, or even reverse disease progress. 

The history of *Homo sapiens* is strongly shaped by human diseases and fighting
against them.

The history of drug discovery is short. However, it has fundamentally improved
human health and life quality.

Drug discovery is one of the most interdisciplinary and collaborative human
enterprises. The first wave was the development in chemistry and physiology. In the second wave, advances in molecular
biology, genetics, and physics made significant contribution. In the third wave, computational approaches such as molecular modelling demonstrated its power. In
the fourth wave, high-dimensional, high-throughput technologies such as omics
and imaging made big impact. Now, we are experiencing the fifth wave, among
others closer integration of clinical-trial and real-world data with preclinical
research (forward and reverse translation), and integrative and iterative
approaches combining both wet-lab experiments and *in silico* data analysis and
modelling. There is little doubt that future waves will bring more opportunities
to find new drugs.

These waves do not only offered new drugs against various diseases. They also gradually revealed the importance of mathematics and informatics in drug discovery. In the first wave, .... In the second wave, mathematical language to describe human genetic information and computational tools to store, retrieve, and analyse them brought disciplines such as cheminformatics and bioinformatics to the core business of pharma research. Next, high-dimensional statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning tools demonstrate their power to mine large-volume data of heterogeneous types. Looking ahead, system-modelling approaches such as network modelling and multiscale modelling become ever more important.
