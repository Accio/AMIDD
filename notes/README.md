Here are the lecture notes that are under development.

I used R markdown and the **bookdown** package (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) to write the notes. Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.
