# From designed comparative experiments to causal inference {#doce}

## What do we want to achieve today

* Principles of designing and analysing comparative experiments
* Know technical terms such as randomization, blocking
* Understand hypothesis testing in the framework of linear regression
* Causal inference, and its use in target proposal in drug discovery
