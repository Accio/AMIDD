# Structure of biomolecules {#structure}

## What do we want to achieve today

* Have a mathematical understanding of DNA and protein structures
* Become familiar with technical terms including the Frenet frame, torsion angles, Ramachandran plot
* Have a high-level understanding of methods determining structures of biomolecules, including X-ray, NMR, and Cryo-EM
* Know where to find and how to read PDB files
* Know how to start PyMOL and visualize a protein of interest
