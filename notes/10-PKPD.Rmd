# Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling {#pkpd}

## What do we want to achieve today

* Have a high-level understanding of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
* Understand mathematical foundations of one-compartment and two-compartment PK models
* Build a joint PK/PD model with R

## Questions

## Background

### Pharmacokinetics

### Pharmacodynamics

### Physiology-based pharmacokinetic modelling

## Mathematical concepts models

### Ordinary differentiatial equations

### Data fitting

### Model comparison and validation

### Stochastic differentiatial equations

## Software

NONMEM as standard, but also open-source, R-based solution is introduced.
