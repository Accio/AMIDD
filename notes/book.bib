In our view, the key to tackling the challenges such issues pose to both the future viability of the pharmaceutical industry and advances in healthcare is to substantially increase the number and quality of innovative, cost-effective new medicines, without incurring unsustainable R\&D costs. However, it is widely acknowledged that trends in industry R\&D productivity have been moving in the opposite direction for a number of years. Here, we present a detailed analysis based on comprehensive, recent, industry-wide data to identify the relative contributions of each of the steps in the drug discovery and development process to overall R\&D productivity. We then propose specific strategies that could have the most substantial impact in improving R\&D productivity.},

	abstract = {In 2011, {AstraZeneca} embarked on a major revision of its research and development (R\&D) strategy with the aim of improving R\&D productivity, which was below industry averages in 2005–2010. A cornerstone of the revised strategy was to focus decision-making on five technical determinants (the right target, right tissue, right safety, right patient and right commercial potential). In this article, we describe the progress made using this '5R framework' in the hope that our experience could be useful to other companies tackling R\&D productivity issues. We focus on the evolution of our approach to target validation, hit and lead optimization, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and drug safety testing, which have helped improve the quality of candidate drug nomination, as well as the development of the right culture, where 'truth seeking' is encouraged by more rigorous and quantitative decision-making. We also discuss where the approach has failed and the lessons learned. Overall, the continued evolution and application of the 5R framework are beginning to have an impact, with success rates from candidate drug nomination to phase {III} completion improving from 4\% in 2005–2010 to 19\% in 2012–2016.},

In order to apply this distance measure, the graphs are characterised by descriptive graph grammars ({DGG}). The proposed distance measure is based on the computation of the minimum number of modifications required to transform an input graph into the reference one. Specifically, the distance measure is defined as the cost of recognition of nodes plus the number of transformations which include node insertion, node deletion, branch insertion, branch deletion, node label substitution and branch label substitution. The major difference between the proposed distance measure and the other ones is the consideration of the cost of recognition of nodes in the distance computation. In order to do this, the principal features of the nodes are described by one or several cost functions which are used to compute the similarity between the input nodes and the reference ones. Finally, an application of this distance measure to the recognition of lower case handwritten English characters is presented.},

The accuracy of structure prediction is known to be improved using experimental mapping data that provide information about the pairing status of single nucleotides, and these data can now be acquired for whole transcriptomes using high-throughput sequencing. Prior methods for using these experimental data focused on predicting structures for sequences assuming that they populate a single structure. Most {RNAs} populate multiple structures, however, where the ensemble of strands populates structures with different sets of canonical base pairs. The focus on modeling single structures has been a bottleneck for accurately modeling {RNA} structure. In this work, we introduce Rsample, an algorithm for using experimental data to predict more than one {RNA} structure for sequences that populate multiple structures at equilibrium. We demonstrate, using {SHAPE} mapping data, that we can accurately model {RNA} sequences that populate multiple structures, including the relative probabilities of those structures.

	abstract = {The reactivity of an {RNA} ribose hydroxyl is shown to be exquisitely sensitive to local nucleotide flexibility because a conformationally constrained adjacent 3‘-phosphodiester inhibits formation of the deprotonated, nucleophilic oxyanion form of the 2‘-hydroxyl group. Reaction with an appropriate electrophile, N-methylisatoic anhydride, to form a 2‘-O-adduct thus can be used to monitor local structure at every nucleotide in an {RNA}. We develop a quantitative approach involving Selective 2‘-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension ({SHAPE}) to map the structure of and to distinguish fine differences in structure for {tRNAAsp} transcripts at single nucleotide resolution. Modest extensions of the {SHAPE} approach will allow {RNA} structure to be monitored comprehensively and at single nucleotide resolution for {RNAs} of arbitrary sequence and structural complexity and under diverse solution environments.},
