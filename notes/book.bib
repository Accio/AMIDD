It also requires strict compliance with regulations on testing and manufacturing standards before a new compound can be used in the general population.All these requirements contribute to the cost increases for new chemical entity ({NCE}) R\&D. The central question raised by this trend is: who in the future will pay for new pharmaceutical R\&D? With this question in mind, this article first describes how the environment for pharmaceutical R\&D has changed over time, and the effect of these changes on R\&D cost, risk and the time invested; second, reviews the literature on the cost of drug discovery and development for {NCEs}; and third, considers the societal value of new drugs.The development of a new drug requires a major investment of capital, human resources and technological expertise.

	abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry is under growing pressure from a range of environmental issues, including major losses of revenue owing to patent expirations, increasingly cost-constrained healthcare systems and more demanding regulatory requirements. In our view, the key to tackling the challenges such issues pose to both the future viability of the pharmaceutical industry and advances in healthcare is to substantially increase the number and quality of innovative, cost-effective new medicines, without incurring unsustainable R\&D costs. However, it is widely acknowledged that trends in industry R\&D productivity have been moving in the opposite direction for a number of years. Here, we present a detailed analysis based on comprehensive, recent, industry-wide data to identify the relative contributions of each of the steps in the drug discovery and development process to overall R\&D productivity. We then propose specific strategies that could have the most substantial impact in improving R\&D productivity.},

	abstract = {In 2011, {AstraZeneca} embarked on a major revision of its research and development (R\&D) strategy with the aim of improving R\&D productivity, which was below industry averages in 2005–2010. A cornerstone of the revised strategy was to focus decision-making on five technical determinants (the right target, right tissue, right safety, right patient and right commercial potential). In this article, we describe the progress made using this '5R framework' in the hope that our experience could be useful to other companies tackling R\&D productivity issues. We focus on the evolution of our approach to target validation, hit and lead optimization, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and drug safety testing, which have helped improve the quality of candidate drug nomination, as well as the development of the right culture, where 'truth seeking' is encouraged by more rigorous and quantitative decision-making. We also discuss where the approach has failed and the lessons learned. Overall, the continued evolution and application of the 5R framework are beginning to have an impact, with success rates from candidate drug nomination to phase {III} completion improving from 4\% in 2005–2010 to 19\% in 2012–2016.},
