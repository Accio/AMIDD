# Cheminformatics {#chemoinfo}

## What do we want to achieve today

* Have a first impression of small molecules as drugs 
* Digital representation of small molecules, in particular SMILEs and InChi keys
* Structure search by fingerprints, Tanimoto coefficient, and graph-edit distances 
* Know information sources of small molecules and drugs, especially ChEBI, CheEMBL, and PubChem

## Questions

## Small molecules are important for life and for drug discovery

## Getting to know two small molecules: caffeine/ valium

## Structural representation of small molecules

### Stereoisomers

Chiral center

The example of Thalidomide

Ofloxacin, levofloxacin and dextrofloxacin are all fluoroquinolone antibiotics. 

* Ofloxacin is a *racemic* (equal) mixture of Levo and Dextro isomers
* Levofloxacin is the more active stereoisomer
* Dextrofloxacin is the less active steroisomer

### SMILES

### InChi key

## Structure search

### Fingerprints

### Tanimoto similarity

### Graph-edit distance

## Structural-activity relationship

## Software and resources

### ChEMBL and ChEBI

### PubChem

### pymol

## Resources for further learning

* The original publication describing the graph edit distance (GED) is [@sanfeliu_distance_1983]. Gao *et al.* [@gao_survey_2010] provided a survey of different ways to determine GED.
* European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) provides great training programs. Their online training courses in small molecule and cheminformatics are great resources particular for beginners: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/topic/small-molecules.
* Companies like NextMove work on improving small-molecule representation and search. Some of their work can be found on SlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/NextMoveSoftware?utm_campaign=profiletracking&utm_medium=sssite&utm_source=ssslideview
