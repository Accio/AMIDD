# Biological sequence analysis {#bioseq}

## Questions

* Are there other genes other the target X with similar structures to X, that may increase the effect of the drug and/or cause side effects?
* Does it make sense to test drug candidates of target X in mouse, rat, or another model species?
* How variable are the coding sequences of the target X among the general population, and among patients of a certain disease?
* Can we design efficacious and safe RNA-based therapies that target gene X potently and specifically to reverse the disease?
